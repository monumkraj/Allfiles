        What is an article? Basically, an article is an adjective. Like
        adjectives, articles modify nouns. English has two articles: the and
        a/an. The is used to refer to specific or particular nouns; a/an is used
        to modify non-specific or non-particular nouns. We call the the definite
        article and a/an the indefinite article. the = definite article a/an =
        indefinite article For example, if I say, "Let's read the book," I mean
        a specific book. If I say, "Let's read a book," I mean any book rather
        than a specific book. Here's another way to explain it: The is used to
        refer to a specific or particular. member of a group. For example, "I
        just saw the most popular movie of the year." There are many movies, but
        only one particular movie is the most popular. Therefore, we use the.

      a and an "A" and "an" signal that the noun modified is indefinite,
      referring to any member of a group. For example: "My daughter really wants
      a dog for Christmas." This refers to any dog. We don't know which dog
      because we haven't<br />
      found the dog yet. "Somebody call a policeman!" This refers to any
      policeman. We don't need a specific policeman; we need any policeman who
      is available. "When I was at the zoo, I saw an elephant!" Here, we're
      talking about a single, non-specific thing, in this case an elephant.
      There are probably several elephants at the zoo, but there's only one
      we're talking about here.
